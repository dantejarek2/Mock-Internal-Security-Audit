# Mock-Internal-Security-Audit

In this Mock Internal Security Audit, Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their IT department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted because she's worried about maintaining compliance and business operations as the company grows without a clear plan, and believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring compliance with regulations related to internally processing, accepting online payments, and conducting business in the European Union.   

The IT manager started by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), established an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completed a risk assessment. The goal of the audit was to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.

The task was to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist.
